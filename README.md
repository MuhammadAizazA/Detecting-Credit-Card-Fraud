# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud

This project focuses on fraud detection using a dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and validation can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection?resource=download). Due to GitHub's size limitations, the dataset files are not included in this repository.

### Instructions for Dataset Usage:

1. Download the dataset from the [provided link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection?resource=download).

2. Extract both files from the downloaded archive into the `src/data` directory of this project.

Now, the dataset is ready to be used for training and validation in both the Python script and Jupyter notebook.
